# Employee-Attrition-Analysis
Introduction
This project focuses on analyzing employee attrition data within an organization using Excel. The objective is to understand the factors driving employee turnover, identify trends in attrition, and uncover insights that HR professionals and management can use to improve retention strategies. The analysis will examine key metrics like total attrition, attrition by job role, education level, age group, gender, tenure, and performance ratings to pinpoint areas of concern and opportunities for improvement.

Objective
 The objectives of this analysis were threefold: first, to determine which employees are at higher risk of leaving; second, to identify the key factors contributing to attrition, such as job satisfaction, workload, or demographics; and third, to provide actionable insights to reduce turnover and create a more stable workforce.

Dataset Overview
 The dataset I used contains employee-level information. It includes demographics like age, gender, marital status, and education level; job-related details such as department, job role, tenure, overtime, and job level; satisfaction and performance ratings; compensation details; and attrition information. Each row represents an employee, and each column provides specific attributes that help us understand attrition patterns.

Data Cleaning and Transformation
 To prepare the data for analysis, I performed several steps. I checked for missing or incorrect values, standardized text, converted data types, and removed duplicates. I also created calculated columns such as age groups, tenure groups, income groups, and an attrition flag where 1 represents employees who left. These transformations allowed for deeper analysis and easier segmentation of the data.

Analysis Approach
 I started by calculating the overall attrition rate using Excel formulas like COUNTIF and COUNTIFS. Then I explored attrition by demographics:
•	I found that employees aged 25–34 had the highest attrition.
•	Single employees tended to leave more than married ones.
•	Differences between genders were small but notable in certain departments.
Next, I looked at tenure-based attrition. Employees with 0–3 years at the company had the highest attrition, which highlights the importance of early employee experience.
I also analyzed performance ratings. High performers generally stay, but when they leave, it’s often due to low salary growth or high workload. Low performers also leave, but losing high performers is more concerning.
Finally, department-wise analysis showed that departments like R&D and Sales had higher attrition, likely due to work pressure, career growth opportunities, and work culture.

Visual Analysis
 To make these insights clear, I used several visual tools:
•	Bar charts to compare attrition across departments, age groups, and gender.
•	Pie charts to show the proportion of employees who left versus stayed.
•	Line graphs to track attrition trends over time and identify spikes.
These visuals helped highlight patterns and areas needing attention quickly, making it easier for HR and management to understand the situation.

Key Insights
 From the analysis, several key insights emerged:
1.	High Attrition Groups: Employees aged 25–34, single employees, and those with low tenure.
2.	Work Factors: Employees working overtime or with low job satisfaction leave at higher rates.
3.	Department Trends: R&D and Sales showed higher turnover, indicating possible issues with workload or career opportunities.
4.	Performance Influence: While low performers leave more, losing high performers is critical and often tied to lack of growth or recognition.
These insights point to areas where the company can intervene, such as improving job satisfaction, career development, and workload management.

Business Relevance
 This analysis is very relevant for HR and management because it allows them to proactively address attrition. By identifying employees at risk early, interventions such as mentorship programs, engagement initiatives, or workload adjustments can be implemented. Ultimately, this reduces hiring and training costs, retains skilled talent, and improves productivity by keeping good employees longer.

Conclusion
 In conclusion, the project successfully used Excel to uncover attrition trends, demographic patterns, and key risk factors. It provides actionable insights that help HR and management retain employees, improve job satisfaction, and create a more stable and productive workforce. This project demonstrates the power of data-driven decision-making in human resource management.
